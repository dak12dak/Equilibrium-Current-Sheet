The present code is developed for calculating the two-dimensional equilibrium magnetoplasma configuration 
of the planar or bent current sheet, satisfying one of the exact solutions of the Vlasov-Maxwell equations, 
derived by Harris, Kan, Fadeev, Manankova, Yoon and Lui, and Semenov, 
which all have been collectively generalized in the paper of Korovinskiy et al. (2018, Ann. Geophys., 36, 641â€“653).
